# AutoFeaTune

**An AI agent that engineers features while you sleep.**

Inspired by [Andrej Karpathy's](https://karpathy.ai/) philosophy of letting AI systems run autonomously on well-defined tasks.

Point it at a CSV. Write two sentences about what you're predicting. Walk away.

The agent reads your data, forms a hypothesis, writes a feature transform, trains XGBoost, and decides whether to keep it — all in a loop. A persistent memory graph accumulates every experiment, every SHAP score, every failed attempt. The next session picks up exactly where the last one left off, armed with everything it learned.

The loop only moves forward. If a feature doesn't improve the composite score, the git ratchet snaps back to the last known-good state and the agent tries something else.

## What it looks like

**Experiment progress — scores, deltas, SHAP importance, live hypothesis tracking:**

**Memory graph — every feature, experiment, hypothesis, and column relationship:**

## How it works

```
You write:
  config.yaml   ← dataset path, target column, metric
  program.md    ← what you're predicting, domain knowledge, ideas

The agent loops:
  1. Read memory graph — what worked, what failed, what's untried
  2. Form a hypothesis — write it to the graph before touching any code
  3. Edit features.py — one targeted transform at a time
  4. Train — XGBoost 5-fold CV, composite score = accuracy − 0.001 × n_features
  5. Ratchet — kept? commit. dropped? revert. repeat.

Stops when:
  • Time budget exceeded
  • N consecutive failures with no improvement path
  • You manually intervene
```

The agent never cheats. Statistical queries are rate-limited and run only on training data. Target-aware features use out-of-fold encoding so training rows never see their own labels.

---

## Why this is different

**Memory compounds across sessions.** The graph isn't reset between runs. It tracks which transform families win on your dataset, which columns are exhausted, which hypotheses were wrong. Session 3 is smarter than session 1.

**One file, total control.** The agent only edits `features.py`. The training harness is fixed. You always know exactly what the agent changed and why.

**Git ratchet = no regression, ever.** `HEAD` always points to the best experiment so far. If a session crashes mid-run, you're still on solid ground.

**SHAP-informed pruning.** After every kept experiment, SHAP values are written to the memory graph. The agent uses them to identify dead features, high-variance features, and untapped columns — not gut instinct.

**Discovery phase finds hidden structure.** Before the loop starts, the system scans for invariant expressions, entity keys, and column relationships that raw feature engineering would miss entirely.

## How to Use

> **Requirements:** Python 3.12+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), and an AI coding agent.

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PranavBedi11/AutoFeaTune.git
cd AutoFeaTune
uv sync
```

### 2. Try the demo (optional)

This downloads the California Housing dataset and wires up everything automatically — good for a first run.

```bash
uv run autoresearch demo
```

### 3. Set up your own dataset

Edit `config.yaml` to point at your CSV, set the target column and metric. Then fill in `program.md` with any domain knowledge — what you're predicting, what signals to look for, what to avoid. The more you put here, the better the agent performs.

```bash
# Or use the interactive wizard:
uv run autoresearch setup data/my_data.csv
```

### 4. Initialize

```bash
uv run autoresearch init       # sets up git ratchet + memory graph
uv run autoresearch prepare    # loads data, creates splits, registers columns
uv run autoresearch discover   # scans for hidden structure (can take 10–20 min — let it finish)
```

### 5. Hand off to an AI agent

Open your AI coding agent of choice (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.), skip any permission prompts so it can run autonomously, and tell it:

> **"Follow `AGENTS.md` exactly. Do not stop until the stop condition is hit."**

The agent reads `AGENTS.md`, enters the feature engineering loop, and runs until it hits the stop condition or you manually intervene. You can leave it running overnight.

---

## Bring your own dataset

```bash
# Interactive setup
uv run autoresearch setup data/my_data.csv

# Or edit config.yaml directly
data_path: data/my_data.csv
target: price
metric: rmse

# Then fill in program.md — this is the most important thing you do
# The more domain knowledge you put here, the better the agent performs
```

**`program.md` matters.** It's where you tell the agent what signals you expect, what to avoid, and what to try. A blank `program.md` works, but a detailed one is the difference between good and great results.

## Supported metrics

| Metric | Direction | Task |
|--------|-----------|------|
| `rmse` | lower is better | regression |
| `mae` | lower is better | regression |
| `accuracy` | higher is better | classification |
| `auc` | higher is better | binary classification |
| `f1` | higher is better | imbalanced classification |
| `logloss` | lower is better | classification |

The constraint that the agent only edits `features.py` is intentional. It makes every experiment auditable, every regression traceable, and every session reproducible.

---

## Scoring

```
Higher-is-better (accuracy, auc, f1):
  composite = cv_score − 0.001 × n_features

Lower-is-better (rmse, mae, logloss):
  composite = cv_score + 0.001 × n_features
```

This forces the agent to justify every feature it adds. A transform that improves accuracy by 0.05% but adds 10 features nets zero gain. The agent has to find features that are genuinely predictive, not just correlated noise.

---

## Development

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest -v
```

The one rule: **the agent only edits `features.py`**. `train.py` and `prepare.py` are fixed — touching them breaks the git ratchet.
